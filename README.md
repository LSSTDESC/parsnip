# ParSNIP

Deep generative modeling of astronomical transient light curves

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/parsnip/badge/?version=latest)](https://parsnip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

## About

ParSNIP learns a generative model of transients from a large dataset
of transient light curves. This code has many applications including
classification of transients, cosmological distance estimation, and
identifying novel transients. A full description of the algorithms
in this code can be found in Boone 2021 (submitted to ApJ).

## Installation and Usage

Instructions on how to install and use ParSNIP can be found on the [ParSNIP
readthedocs page](https://parsnip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
