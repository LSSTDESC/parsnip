# ParSNIP

A generative model of transient light curves

## About

ParSNIP learns a generative model of transients from a large dataset
of transient light curves. This code has many applications including
classification of transients, cosmological distance estimation, and
identifying novel transients. A full description of the algorithms
in this code can be found in Boone 2021 (in prep.).
